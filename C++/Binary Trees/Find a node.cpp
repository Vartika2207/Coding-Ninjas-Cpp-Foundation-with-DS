/**********
Code : Find a node

For a given Binary Tree of type integer and a number X, find whether a node exists in the tree with data X or not.
 Input Format:
The first line of each test case contains elements of the first tree in the level order form. The line consists of values of nodes separated by a single space. In case a node is null, we take -1 in its place.

The second line of each test case contains the node value you have to find.

Note:
The above format was just to provide clarity on how the input is formed for a given tree.
The sequence will be put together in a single line separated by a single space. Hence, for the above-depicted tree, the input will be given as:

1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Output Format:
The only line of output prints 'true' or 'false'.

The output of each test case should be printed in a separate line.
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5

Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec.
Sample Input 1:
8 3 10 1 6 -1 14 -1 -1 4 7 13 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
7
Sample Output 1:
true
Explanation For Output 1:
Clearly, we can see that 7 is present in the tree. So, the output will be true.
Sample Input 2:
2 3 4 -1 -1 -1 -1
10
Sample Output 2:
false
